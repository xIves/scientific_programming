Background:
You work for a company that specializes in developing machine learning models for  
image recognition. Your company has collected a lot of photos, and you are 
asked to develop Python code using OOP to enrich the photo database using data 
derived from the photos like the number of pixels, the RGB-colors, etc.

# Required Python libraries
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

1.) Create an ImageAnalyzer class which is able to:
- read an image (e.g. a photo in .jpg format)
- plot the pimage
- get the image size (numer pf pixels in rows and columns)
- get values of single pixels
- plot a gray-scale version of the image
- create a single plot showing overlapping histograms of RGB colors
- write the RGB-color values to separate columns in a pandas data frame 

2.) Analyze at different photos by using the ImageAnalyzer class. You 
   can find such photos by using Google photo search or on Flickr.
