# OOP examples with Python: Animations
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that these exercises must be accomplished on your local computer!

1.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'turtle_race_OOP_example_Python.ipynb' step 
    by step. In class, we will make a deep dive into this OOP example 
    and discuss single code lines.

2.) Use the Turtle race example and add additional turtles. Note that, currently, 
    you must make changes the position of text and lenght of the finish-lines
    by hand, if you add additional turtles.

3.) Also look at the other OOP - example showing animations in 'bouncing_ball_
    OOP_example_Python.ipynb'. In this example, classes are used to create objects 
    with certain attributes such as the velocity and size of bouncing balls Try to 
    change the parameters in this example and look how the results change.
