Background:
You work for a company that produces computer games. Your task is to 
create a simple agent-based model with the following settings:

- The game has a quadratic model space which consists of a number of grid cells.
- The number of grid cells in x and y direction can be defined by the user.
- There are two agents which can randomly move in the model space.
- The agents are shown as two grid cells and have different colors.
- The model has a counter which counts up if agents occur in the same grid cell.
- There is a finit number of iterations which can be pre-defined.
- The agents and model iterations are shown in a graphic.
- The game should run in a Jupyter notebook as a simulation.

Hint: You can use the Python libraries:
- random
- numpy
- matplotlib
- IPython
