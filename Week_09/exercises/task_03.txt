# Agent-based modeling: Forest Fire, Schelling Segregation, Swarm Behavior
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that these exercises must be accomplished on your local computer!

1.) In Python, different libraries can be used to build agent-based models. 
    Example libraries are 'mesa' and 'agentpy'. The exercises contain
    the following simulation models:
    - Forest Fire Simulation (mesa)
    - Schelling's Segregation Model (mesa)
    - Boids Flocking Model: Simulation of Swarm Behavior (agentpy)

    Look at the code of these models in the respective folders.

2.) To run the Forest Fire Simulation, cd into the 'forest_fire_simulation'
    folder and type: mesa runserver. A browser window will open in which you
    will find a menu with: Start, Step and Reset. Create different simulations 
    with varying tree densities. After model run, close the terminal window.

3.) To run Schelling's Segregation Model, cd into the 'schelling_segregation'
    folder and type: mesa runserver. A browser window will open in which you
    will find a menu with: Start, Step and Reset. Create different simulations 
    with varying agent density, fraction minority and homophily. After model 
    run, close the terminal window.
    
4.) To run Boids Flocking Model, open the Jupyter notebook 'swarm_behavior.ipynb'.
    Note that this model requires the 'agentpy' library. In the section 
    'Parameter settings for 3D simulation', change the parameters to create 
    different simulations.
