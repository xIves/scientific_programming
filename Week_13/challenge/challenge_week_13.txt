Background: 
The file 'hydro_data.csv' contains hydrological data of the river Thur. 
The hydro data were collected by means of a web scraper 'water_level_data.py'
You want to display the data using a web application showing a bar chart 
with the drain in m3/s and a line chart with the water level in cm. The web 
application should be built in a way that the data and graphic are updated 
every 10 seconds.

Hint: The following files are needed:
- app.py
- index.html
- water_level_data.py
