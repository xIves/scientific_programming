# Classification model example with Pythoj and flask
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) In the folder 'flask_classification_model_example', run the Jupyter notebook 'model.ipynb'.
    This generates a classification model based on the Iris data and stores it in .pkl format.

2.) In the folder 'flask_classification_model_example' run the Python script app.py. 
    Open the URL shown in the Terminal: http://127.0.0.1:8080. To make model 
    predictions, provide values for a single Iris flower, e.g.: 
    sepal.length  -> 2
    sepal.width   -> 3
    petal.length  -> 4
    petal.width   -> 6

3.) Look at the file structure of this application and try to understand which 
    files are responsible for which part of the web application.
    
    After completing these exercises, you should understand:
    - how to create and evaluate a classification model
    - how a knn (k-nearest neighbor) model works
    - how to save a model using the pickle (.pkl) format 
    - how to load a model using the (.pkl) format 
    - the role of a label encoder in a classification model
    - the role of html-templates in flask applications
    - how app routing works in flask (see @app.route in the Python code)
