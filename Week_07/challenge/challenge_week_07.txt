Background:
You work for a company that specializes in collecting and preparing RSS-feeds 
from online news papers. Specifically, this involves collecting and processing 
the latest news and making it available to stock traders for algorithmic trading. 
You are asked to develop a workflow with Python code and functions using 
procedural programming to collect and analyze RSS feeds.

# Example RSS-Feeds (germ., engl.)
https://www.spiegel.de/schlagzeilen/index.rss
https://www.nzz.ch/international.rss
https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Europe.xml
https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml

# Required Python libraries
import os
import requests
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter
from wordcloud import WordCloud
from requests_html import HTMLSession

1.) Create a Jupyter notebook and write functions which collect single and 
    multiple RSS-Feeds and store the data of the RSS-Feeds such as title, 
    publication date and description in a pandas data frame. You can use the
    Python libraries requests and requests_html for this purpose.

2.) As part of the procedure, find the most frequent words per RSS-Feed title. 
    You can use the Python library collections (class Counter) for this purpose.

3.) As part of the procedure, create a word cloud from all RSS-Feed titles. You
    can use the Python library wordcloud (class WordCloud) for this purpose.
