Background:
You work for a company that specializes in crypto-currency trading using 
trading bots. You are asked to implement an exploratory data analysis (EDA)
of crypto-currency prices into the process which should include:

- a download of selected crypto-currency prices using the coingecko Web API
- at least the following rypto-currencies: bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, near
- a bar chart showing the prices of different crypto-currencies
- a histogram (price of a single crypto-currency over time)
- a boxplot (price of a single crypto-currency over time)
- a scatterplot (relationship between two different crypto-currency prices)
- a scatterplot matrix (relationship between > 2 crypto-currency prices)
- a heatmap with correlation matrix of crypto-currency prices in the data

Answer the question: Which crypto-currency prices are higher correlated than others?

Hint: To get data, you can use:
from pycoingecko import CoinGeckoAPI
