# Vizualizations / Graphics in Python
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'visualizations_graphics_Python.ipynb' step by step. 
    You should understand which elements a matplotlib graphic contains and how it 
    can be created. This includes:
    - named colors
    - marker symbols
    - formatting axes and setting limits and ticks
    - settings axes labels and plot title
    - including and formatting legends
    - text annotations
    - grid
    - multiplots / subplots
    - saving figures to files
    - basic plot types like line chart, histogram, bar chart, boxplot ...

    You must know how graphics can be created using the Python libaries:
    - seaborn (e.g. boxplots)
    - plotly (interactive graphics)
    - bokeh (interactive graphics)
    - folium / leaflet (interactive maps)

    You also must know how the different graphic types can be interpreted.
    
    The functionality of the pillow library (image processing) should also be clear.

2.) When using graphics to explore data, ist is essential that you can interprete
    graphics correctly. Read the explanations of basic graphic types on
    the following web sites (mandatory reading):

    Try to answer the following questions with regard to the car data:

    a) What does the box of the boxplot show?
    b) What does a scatterplot matrix show?
    c) In a histogram showing a right-skewed distribution of variable values, is 
       the median larger or smaller than the mean?
    d) In a boxplot, what is the meaning of the vertical lines called 'whiskers'?
    e) What exactly does a heatmap show, and how can the values be interpreted?
