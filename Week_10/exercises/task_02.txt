# Enhancing performance in Python
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'enhancing_performance_Python.ipynb' step by step. 
    You should understand that the performance in Python (read & write data, make 
    calculations) highly depends on the functions you use, and that this performance 
    can be optimized.

2.) Simulate a car data set which contains 10 Mio. cars. The data should include:
    - id       # car id (int)
    - make     # make (str or 'object' in pandas)
    - mileage  # mileage (int)
    - hp       # horse power (int)
    - price    # price (int)

    Hint: For the simulation of numerical examples see examples in the Jupyter 
    notebook above. To simulate a list of nominal values (e.g. 'make'), look at 
    the following example:

    import random

    # Number of records
    n_records = 25

    # Basis list from which the makes are taken
    make = ['VW', 'BMW', 'FIAT', 'FORD', 'NISSAN']

    # Randomly create a number of k records from 'make'
    random_make = random.choices(make, k=n_records)
    print(random_make)

3.) Answer the questions: Which is the fastest way to calculate the price per 
    hp from the data? Which is the fastes way to write the data to a .csv file?
